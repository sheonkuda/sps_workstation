      <p>My name is Sheon Mwapinza, I am from Zimbabwe! I am a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvanina 
          and I am studying electrical engineering. I love sports, playing chess and I love playing with my baby brother.</p>
      <p>My journey in computer science has been most fulfulling. Nothing compares to the feeling that mauls you after spending an entire night
         awake working on the SPS portfolio and are finally done. Although painful, there is a silver lining to spending these nights awake,
         every hour spent working on the projects, homeworks, and assignemnt means more knowledge and experience gained. Some of the projects I 
         have worked on are:</p>

         <p>Rapid Roll (CIS 120– Programming languages and techniques)<br>
           &nbsp &nbsp •	Built an object-oriented Rapid Roll game using Java to implement the backend and Java swing library to implement the frontend<br>
           &nbsp &nbsp •	The goal of the project was to get to accustomed to managing a project from ideation to design and implementation, and to gain more experience with backend and frontend development in Java<br>
        <br> Penn-Pals (CIS 120– Programming languages and techniques) <br>
           &nbsp &nbsp •	Built a messaging application for Penn Students using a client server<br>
           &nbsp &nbsp •	Learnt backend implementation in Java which included creation and deletion of channels, adding and removing people to channels, sending messages, and handling server responses<br>
         <br>Paint (CIS 120– Programming languages and techniques)<br>
           &nbsp &nbsp •	Used Ocaml to develop the backend and GUI of a paint application (similar to Microsoft paint)<br>
           &nbsp &nbsp •    Gained experience working with graphics contexts in Ocaml, implementation of various data structures such as: stacks, queues, heaps, etc and I also got exposure to backend and frontend development in Ocaml<br>
         <br>Penn Electric Racing <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp•	Worked on the electrical hardware team (16 people) to build and debug circuits, and design PCBs to be used in building an electric race car<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp•	Designed and implemented the braking system of the car, and overcurrent and malfunction protection measures <br>
